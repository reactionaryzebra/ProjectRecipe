### Intro
Savory is a website which allows you to connect with your friends around food.  Search through millions of recipes and filter based on your dietary needs.  Save all of your favorite recipes to your cookbook to share with your friends.  When you have all found the perfect dish, organize a potuck and share everything you've learned.

  2. Search the recipe database for anything you want to cook
  3. Save the recipes you like to your cookbook
  4. Search through the cookbooks of other Savory users 
  5. Add other users with recipes you like to your friends list
  6. Organize a potluck by setting a date, adding your friends, and adding the dishes you want cooked
